A simple Windows program to record small WebM screencasts.

Built atop the abilties of
<a href="https://ffmpeg.org" target="_blank">ffmpeg</a>.

Capture frames within the recording region.
Press _Record_, or use the global hotkey to start recording.
Optionally, capture system audio in your screencast.

The built-in frame browser provides the ability to select and remove frames
to quickly clean-up your finished recording.

Captured frames are then combined with an ffmpeg command.

WebMCam is a WebM alternative to [GifCam](http://blog.bahraniapps.com/gifcam/).
