Enhancements for the [KWin](https://userbase.kde.org/KWin) Quick Tile feature.

Quick Tiling uses a _keyboard shortcut_ or _mouse gesture_ to quickly tile
a window to a screen edge or screen corner.

Similar to window snapping in [ChromeOS](https://www.omgchrome.com/hidden-window-snap-resize-feature-chrome-os/), in
[Windows 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk8yTBLEj3c), and in
[GNOME Shell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj5KjAm-LE).
